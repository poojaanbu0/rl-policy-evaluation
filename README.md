# POLICY EVALUATION

## AIM
The aim is to implement a reinforcement learning agent that can navigate environments from the gym-walk library, which simulates grid-like or walking environments. The agent will learn an optimal policy to reach desired goals based on the given reward structure.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
The task is to implement and evaluate a reinforcement learning agent in a walking environment using gym. The agent must learn to make decisions that maximize its total reward through trial and error, based on feedback from the environment.

## POLICY EVALUATION FUNCTION
The policy evaluation function aims to compute the value of a given policy by iteratively calculating the expected rewards of following the policy in each state until convergence, allowing for better estimation of state values under the current policy.

## OUTPUT:
Mention the first and second policies along with its state value function and compare them

## RESULT:
Thus, the reinforcement learning agent successfully learns an optimal policy for navigating the environment, improving its decisions through iterations.
